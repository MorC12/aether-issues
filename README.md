##The Aether II Issue Tracker
This is the issue tracker for the the Minecraft mod, the Aether II.

Looking for the mod itself? Take a look [over here](http://www.gilded-games.com/aether/).

### Creating issues
- Verify that nobody else has already posted a similar issue. It's easier to manage if there's not a dozen duplicates.

  If the issue is closed, it's probably fixed and ready to be released in the next version of the Aether. Otherwise, feel free to chime in on the conversation!

- Use English when making issues. If English isn't your primary language or you don't speak it at all, feel free to use Google Translate.

- Be concise. Giving us the information we need and keeping it short and sweet keeps the developers happy!

- Provide the relevant crash logs (if your issue is a crash) and screenshots/videos (if releveant). You can use [Github's Gist service](https://gist.github.com) to post huge logs without cluttering up your issue.
